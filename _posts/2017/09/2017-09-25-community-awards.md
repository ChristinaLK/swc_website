Do you know someone who you consider a respected member of 
the Software Carpentry community?  Has this person made
valuable contributions to Software Carpentry's work?

If so, consider nominating this person for a Community Service Award!

The Community Service Award was inaugurated last year 
to recognize the crucial role of volunteer contributions
to the work of the Software Carpentry Foundation.  This award acknowledges 
work which, in the Steering Committee's opinion, significantly improves the 
Foundation's fulfillment of its mission and benefits the broader community. 

For full details, including how to nominate someone, 
see [this page]({{site.url}}/scf/awards/).  Nominations are welcome at
any time, but submit them soon, as the Steering Committee will choose and 
announce awards in December.
